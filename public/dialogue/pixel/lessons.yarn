title: ConceptExplanation
---
<<if $concept == "variable">>
    Pixel: Variables are like labeled boxes 📦
    Pixel: You put stuff in them, and you can change what's inside later!
    Pixel: In games, you might store the player's score, health, or position.
<<elseif $concept == "function">>
    Pixel: Functions are like recipes! 🍕
    Pixel: You write the steps once, then follow the recipe whenever you need it.
    Pixel: Super useful for actions that happen multiple times in games!
<<elseif $concept == "loop">>
    Pixel: Loops repeat code automatically! 🔁
    Pixel: Instead of writing the same thing 100 times, write it once in a loop!
    Pixel: Perfect for moving multiple enemies or checking all items in an inventory.
<<else>>
    Pixel: Let me explain {$concept} in a simple way...
<<endif>>
-> Show me in code
    <<showCodeExample($concept)>>
