## Critical Issues Found

### High Priority
1. **RPG Game**: Inventory system component not generating in code
2. **Rate Limiting**: HTTP 429 errors when running intensive tests

### Medium Priority
1. **Game-Specific Features**: Some game types generate basic templates without full feature implementation
2. **Test Script Issues**: Project save validation incorrectly reporting failures (API works correctly)

### Low Priority
1. **Code Optimization**: Generated code could be more modular
2. **Asset Integration**: Asset system not fully utilized in generated code

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Fix RPG Inventory Generation**: Update compiler to include inventory system for RPG games
