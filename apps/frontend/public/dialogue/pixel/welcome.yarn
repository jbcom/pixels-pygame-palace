Pixel: Python is THE language for creative coding! Here's why it's amazing:
Pixel: • It reads like English - no cryptic symbols everywhere!
Pixel: • Pygame gives us superpowers for graphics and sound! 
Pixel: • It's what real game developers use for prototypes!
Pixel: • And the community is incredibly helpful!
-> Sounds awesome!
